            Iâ€™m Basile. I live near Capbreton in France, where I code some

            <p>
              As long as I can remember, I was always fascinated by computers,
              video games and internet. But the true passion came when I
              discovered programming at about 20 during my first year of
              engineering school. I was amazed by the power of this tool and the
              possibilities it offers.
            </p>
            <p>
              My dad was kind of a geek, he was always playing video games with
              me, Gran Turismo, Tekken, Counter Strike. Also, he teaches me how
              to build a computer.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started to learn programming during high school in France (BTS),
              first with raw PHP, SQL and CSS. Remember the era of{' '}
              <code className="rounded bg-stone-500 p-0.5 text-sm text-stone-900">
                float: left;
              </code>{' '}
              to make kind of flexbox layout ? ðŸ˜‚ Apps we were building were
              ugly and lacking of true interactivity, but it was a good start.
              This is where I had to learn JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other than programming, I love to play video games, but also
              recently fell in love with combat sports, especially kickboxing.
              After many years without any sport, it was really hard to get back
              in shape, but Iâ€™m really proud of my progress. ðŸ’ªðŸ¥Š
